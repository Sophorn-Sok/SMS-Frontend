/**
 * Next.js 16 "Proxy" (formerly Middleware). Optimistic auth gate only:
 * it checks for the presence of the backend `refresh_token` cookie and does
 * NOT verify it (the refresh secret must not reach the edge). Real identity
 * and role checks happen client-side in each portal's <PortalGuard>.
 *
 * Redirecting an already-signed-in user away from /sign-in is left to the
 * sign-in page itself (it knows the resolved role) to avoid a redirect loop
 * with the "/" -> "/sign-in" server redirect.
